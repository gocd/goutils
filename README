H2 Database primer
==================

This is used to prime/migrate an instance of H2 database to bring it up to the schema that you desire. You need to make sure you point the primer to the current Go installation's database script directory.

For e.g., if your
* Go installation is at /var/lib/go-server
* H2 database file is located at /tmp/cruise.h2.db
you can run

$ java -cp goutils.jar com.thoughtworks.go.utils.primer.H2Primer /var/lib/go-server/db/h2deltas /tmp/cruise

NOTE: Make sure you provide the H2 database file location without the .h2.db extension


H2 Database exporter
====================

This is used to export all Go data from an H2 instance.

For e.g., if your
* H2 database file is located at /tmp/cruise.h2.db
* Output directory for the dump is at /tmp/output
you can run

$ java -cp goutils.jar com.thoughtworks.go.utils.export.tablebased.H2ToTableBasedSql /tmp/cruise /tmp/output

NOTE: Make sure you provide the H2 database file location without the .h2.db extension
